TODO:
    - Convert the loaded images to jpgs before saving
    - The working directory should look like this
        - info.config
            - Stores the Meta data
        - original.jpg
            - The original image
        - current.jpg
            - The current result after operating on original image
    
    Server workflow example:
    
    *   website inputs -> info.config 
    *                          v
    *   original.jpg -> | Computations | -> current.jpg 
    

    - Store the original image + settings into database for going back to other projects?
        - Storing the original + Meta data Reduces the amount of data used on the server
        - This is similar to how lightroom works. 
        - Cap the amount of images in the database. Maybe only 100 for now?
    - If there is an image then display it instead of the upload image graphic
        - Add an animation for dragging and dropping an image
    - Add in a horizontal scroll for style images.

    - Add in Resolution downscale slider
    - Add in Resolution upscale slider
    - Add in algorithmic pre/post processing
        - Noise reduction
        - Gaussian Blur
    - Allow for processing to be dragged and droped to determine order?
        - Ie. if I want a gaussian blur before style transfer I would drop the 
            blur slider before the style selecter
        - generate a function pointer mapping and function order list to do this.
            - Functions in function mapp must input and output the same kwargs. 
                and the function will handle parsing the kwargs correctly.
    - Add upper limit on the resolution of the pre-transfer image
    - Add upper limit on the resolution of the post-upscaled image
    - Find a way to deal with users that are not super users
    - Replace the task menues things at the home page with image links to the 
        different tools on the site. 
    - Capture processing data information to determine bottlenecks
    - DARK MODE! eventually
